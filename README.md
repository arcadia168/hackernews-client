# React Node Express HackerNews Client Excercise

A coding exercise to create a frontend for HackerNews.
Runs on a simple Express server in the Node.js runtime and uses React.js.
Uses `react-bootstrap` for simple styling and components.

Has some simple Jest snapshot tests, testing could be much better.

Can be easily uploaded to Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Heroku or AWS as a Node.js application and run 'out of the box'.
